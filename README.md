Code for Valva + Gerber 2024 (_preprint_). Files run with NLSA base code found here: https://github.com/dg227/NLSA. Run by changing steps in QBO_run.m to true, after adjusting data files to the correct paths on your computer. 

I'm happy to take any questions etc. Data used in the paper is either ERA5 or $w^*$ from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7081436.
